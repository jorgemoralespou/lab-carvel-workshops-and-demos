In this workshop you worked through how to install application packages
to a Kubernetes cluster using `kctrl` and `kapp-controller`.

For more information check out the [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) web site.

Note that although we used the `kctrl package` command, if you are using the
`tanzu package` command for TKG or TCE, the process is similar, albeit the
command line options may be slightly different in some cases depending on the
versions used.
